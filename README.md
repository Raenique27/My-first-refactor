My First Refactor

1. Refactored code for the Horiseon website that was already written.
2. Updated the <title> section so that the website would have a more descriptive title instead of the tab just saying website when it is pulled up.
3. Added comments through out HTML file so that each section is made clear as well as making it easier to read.
4. Added a <nav> element as well as <section> elements.
5. Added an Id="" for the Search Engine Optimization <div> so that now when you click on it in the <nav> bar it takes you to that section on the website. 
6. Updated style sheet to minimize repitition of code. 
7. Added <footer> and <header> elements to not have so many <div> elements.
8. Added alt="" attributes to the images.
